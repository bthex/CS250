How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I usually have a hard time trying to figure out what a user needs instead of wants. Early in this course we had a psuedo Product Owner
 and customer meeting where we had to pick out all the user wants and create stories. After creating the user stories
 we placed them in order of most important to least. This was a good practice for me. Being able to see everything the user wants 
in one place makes it easier to find the needs and place them in the front of the queue.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I am not very organized when it comes to programming. I usually write to much code and spend a mojority of my 
time testing and making sure it will function. I am going to make an effort to add the backlog and stories to my future work.
Haiving everything organized as it was for this course made understanding what steps still needed to be completed easy to see.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think being a good team member is software development is being a good communicator and self manager. Being able to manage
your time correctly and complete your task on time increases the teams productivity. Also, communticating when you are stuck
on an issue allows more experienced memebers help you instead of struggling and falling behind.
